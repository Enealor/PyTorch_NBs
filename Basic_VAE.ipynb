    "# A Very Brief Look of Variational Autoencoders\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary\n",
    "This notebook describes and implements a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) in pytorch. VAEs are a type of generative model. By providing a dataset, a variational autoencoder uses variational Bayesian methods to generate similar examples. Once trained, it can be used to turn noise into images.\n",
    "\n",
    "These notes are based off this [VAE tutorial](https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.05908) and the explanation provided in [these notes](https://deepgenerativemodels.github.io/notes/vae/). The target audience for this notebook is someone who has read about VAEs but want to see another explanation or an implementation. Further reading is provided below. If you are just interested in the implementation, you can skip the first half of this notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, it should be known that $\\simeq$ is used below to denote that two values are equal up to a constant difference. Specifically, if $a \\simeq b$, then $a = b + \\text{constant}$. This is used as constants are ignored during optimization. This is not to be confused with $a \\approx b$, which means that a is approximately b."

    "## Training Objective\n",
    "Suppose we have a set of observations $D = \\{x_1, \\dots, x_N\\}$. We want to generate examples similar to the observations in $D$, but how do we start? One approach is to find a probability distribution $p$ such that $p(x)$ is high for $x$ similar to an observation in $D$, and low for dissimilar observations. However, if the observations are high dimensional, then the dependencies between dimensions can be complex. Untangling these dependencies can make finding $p$ difficult. To alleviate this, we can introduce a latent variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "A latent variable is a variable that is inferred from the observation. In the right situations, it encodes high level information that can be used to recreate the observation. Introducing this latent variable means that we are now looking for $p(x, z)$, where $z$ is our latent variable. We can break down this distribution into $p(x|z)p_\\ell(z)$. The benefit is that this gives us a generative process: we can first generate a $z$ according to $p_\\ell$ and then use $p(x|z)$ to generate an $x$.\n",
    "\n",
    "At this point, we can always recover $p(x)$ using integration as we have\n",

    "$$p(x) = \\int_\\mathcal{Z} p(x|z)p_\\ell(z)dz,$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\mathcal{Z}$ is the space of all possible latent variables. However, this integral is generally intractable. This difficulty is important as our goal is to make $p$ similar to $p_D$. Instead of optimizing $p$ directly, we will use variational Bayesian methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "Variational Bayesian methods are aimed at approximation the posterior. We are attempting to approximate $p(z|x)$ with another distribution $q_\\lambda(z)$, where $\\lambda = \\lambda(x)$. We are forced to use an approximation as $p(z|x)$ is just as difficult to evaluate as $p(x)$. However, if we had the posterior $p(z|x)$, then we could find $p(x)$ using \n",

This means we draw $\\epsilon \\sim N(0, I)$ and let $z = \\mu+\\Sigma^{1/2}\\epsilon$, where $\\Sigma^{1/2}$ is the Choletsky factorization of $\\Sigma$ (effectively giving us a square root of the matrix).

We then replace this with the evidence lower bound to change goals to minimizing $-\\mathbb{E}_{q_\\lambda}\\left[\\log(p(x, z)) - \\log(q_{\\lambda}(z))\\right]$.

The first term, $\\Vert x - g_\\theta(z) \\Vert^2_2$, is optimized by choosing parameters for the decoder that produce accurate reconstructions. The term $\\Vert z \\Vert^2_2$ is optimized by making the latent variable small; this is most directly done by decreasing the mean. The final term, $-\\sum_i \\log \\sigma_i$, has more flexibility as it's able to take both positive and negative values. If $\\sigma_i$ is small, then $z$ has little variance, but $-\\log\\sigma_i$ will be large. On the other hand, if $\\sigma_i$ is large, then $z$ has a lot of variance (which makes the decoder's job harder) but $-\\log\\sigma_i$ is now a negative value. In essence, the scale parameter can reduce the loss if chosen to be large, but this is only feasible if the decoder can still make accurate representations. Meanwhile, the entire expectation can be made smaller by adjusting $q_\\lambda$."

    "\n",
    "While this form of loss can be useful, it turns out that the KL loss is too restrictive in some cases. Specifically, we have that if $q_\\lambda(z) = p(z|x)$, then the Monte Carlo loss above will be $0$, but the KL loss here will still have a constant entropy. Thus, the Monte Carlo error above should be used if we suspect that we can learn $\\lambda$ well enough that $q_\\lambda(z) \\approx p(z|x)$. This is explained in [Sticking the Landing](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.09194) by Roeder et al, which also notes that the MC form is easier to apply when using normalizing flows.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similar to above, the result of optimization on the individual components can be interpreted for this loss. The new term, the KL divergence, is minimized when $q_\\lambda$ has the same distribution $p_\\ell$. Thus, the KL term pushes the posterior distribution towards being like the latent distribution. It's worth noting that this is not necessarily desirable, as $q_\\lambda$ is supposed to approximate $p(z|x)$. More directly, it's encouraging the encoded mean to be close to $0$ and encouraging $\\sigma_i$ to be close to 1 (so that $\\sigma_i^2-1+\\log \\sigma_i = 0$)."

By comparing $x$ and $\\hat{x}$, we have a loss for the decoder. The total loss of the variational autoencoder is the sum of these two losses. Because we are minimizing the sum, there is no guarantee that both components will decrease. In fact, the encoder loss typically increases while the decoder loss typically decreases.

I had originally believed it was a result of using an inappropriate loss function, but it turns out that this is actually caused by the decoder using the average reconstruction. In our notation, this means the decoder is learning to return $\\mathbb{E}_{p(x|z)}[x]$. The paper also discuss how to avoid blurry images.\n",

Another approach based on this paper is offered in [convex combination linear Inverse Autoregressive Flow](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.0232), which is more easily applied.\n",
